/**
 * This package holds all of the classes for easy grid use.  A 2D grid can be navigated through in many different
 * vocabularies that end up being essentially the same.  The hierarchies setup here should make the readability
 * of the resulting code much higher and less verbose.  At some point this could be expanded to a third dimension.
